# TODO List

This is the list of tasks to be completed for the **xFPL** project. The tasks are organized into sections based on the projectâ€™s phases (e.g., data collection, model development, frontend integration, testing, etc.). Each task is prioritized and can be marked as complete when done.

---

## 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing
- [x] Identify and download historical FPL data from [vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League](https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League)
- [ *in progress* ] Write ETL scripts to load raw data into the system
- [ *in progress* ] Clean and normalize player data (handle missing values, standardize formats)
<!-- - [ ] Extract and preprocess fixture data for upcoming gameweeks -->
- [ *in progress* ] Engineer key features from raw data (e.g., average points, fixture difficulty)
<!-- - [ ] Integrate external football data (optional: xG, xA, etc.) -->

## 2. Model Development
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on player statistics
- [ ] Develop initial regression model to predict points in next gameweek
    - [ ] Select features for model training
    - [ ] Tune hyperparameters (e.g., number of trees in Random Forest)
- [ ] Implement classification models (for binary outcomes like clean sheets, goals)
- [ ] Evaluate model performance (use cross-validation, RMSE, MAE)
- [ ] Optimize models based on evaluation results

## 3. Recommendation System
- [ *in progress* ] Outline/Finalize system functionalities
- [ ] Implement logic to generate transfer and captaincy recommendations
- [ ] Test recommendation logic with historical data
- [ ] Implement functionality to update recommendations based on real-time data
- [ ] Add logic for bench and squad rotation suggestions

## 4. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Design basic UI to display player recommendations
<!-- - [ ] Implement interactive frontend (React, Flask, or other technology) -->
- [ ] Integrate model outputs with frontend to provide real-time recommendations
- [ ] Test frontend with multiple scenarios

## 5. Testing & Evaluation
<!-- - [ ] Write unit tests for data pipeline (`tests/test_data_pipeline.py`)
- [ ] Write unit tests for model (`tests/test_models.py`) -->
- [ ] Perform offline simulations with historical FPL seasons
- [ ] Conduct real-time testing during current FPL season
- [ ] Collect feedback from real FPL users
- [ ] Compare performance with existing tools (e.g., FPL Scout, Fantasy Football Hub)

## 6. Documentation & Finalization
- [x] Create `README.md` for repository
<!-- - [ ] Document setup instructions in `docs/setup_guide.md` -->
- [ ] Add model explanation and feature descriptions in documentation
- [ ] Write final project report/presentation

<!-- ## 7. Future Enhancements (Optional)
- [ ] Integrate advanced metrics like expected goals (xG) or expected assists (xA)
- [ ] Build a more robust user feedback system for recommendations
- [ ] Explore additional machine learning models (e.g., deep learning models)
- [ ] Extend the system to other fantasy football leagues (e.g., Champions League, La Liga) -->

## Notes
- Keep track of weekly progress.
- Prioritize essential tasks for initial release.
- Move completed tasks to the top of the list to reflect progress.
